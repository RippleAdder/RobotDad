# RobotDad
Robot Dad demonstrates the use of several large language models glued together by some python to provide answers to my kids' questions

## Pre-Requisites

You will need API keys for the following services to run this locally:

* OpenAI (https://openai.com/) - used for ChatGPT to run questions against
* ElevenLabs (https://elevenlabs.io/) - used for speech synthesis and voice cloning
* PicoVoice (https://picovoice.ai/) - Porcupine is used to detect the wake word
